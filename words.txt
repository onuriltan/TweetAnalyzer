News  keeps  saying  the  gov't  is  confident  that  the  website  will  handle  it  OK.  #census2016  https://t.co/dv1AUNRwJm  Perhaps  unsurprisingly,  I  can't  even  get  onto  the  #census2016  website.  @BevanShields  @ABSCensus  @sirlui  #2016census  #census2016  #census  #pleasetryagain  #pleasetryagain  #pleasetryagain  #pleasetryagain  Product  manager:  "Have  you  guys  performance  tested  the  #census2016  website?"

No  point  filling  out  the  census...  Already  overloaded  with  data  #census2016  #censusfail  #theresfifteenminutesiwontevergetback  I  had  absolutely  no  problems  about  an  hour  ago,  very  quick,  cudos  to  the  the  ABS  ICT  people!  #census2016  Waste  of  effort.  Joke.  Completed  then  unable  to  submit  or  save.  #census2016  What's  happening?  Not  #census2016  thanks  to  server  overload  #censusfail  #census2016  I'm  buggered  if  I'm  going  to  pay  a  fine  for  not  accessing  a  site  that  won't  let  me  in.  #iamtrying  #census2016  #EpicFail  My  little  blue  loading  line  ain't  moved  for  quite  some  time  #census2016  https://t.co/PzdQeJqUZ2  Do  I  have  to  stay  awake  all  night  attempting  to  log  on  or  can  I  catch  some  sleep?  #census2016  @ABSCensus  @hamishblake  maybe  they  could  have  predicted  this  #census2016  and  actually  prepared!  Just  wondering  will  #census2016  show  Australia  has  a  shortage  of  elite  athletes  living  in  the  country?  What  a  joke  30  min  of  data  entry  &  now  the  website  crashed  without  saving.  #census2016

Nobody  can  access  ANYTHING  #census2016  https://t.co/dtSNmOJA5k  @SkyNewsAust  -  Lots  of  people  reporting  the  Census  website  is  retiring  and  timing  out  #census2016  #jonesandco  #census2016  website  has  crashed.....what  a  farce!!  So  this  #census2016  seems  to  be  going  to  plan  -  someone  else's  plan.  Maybe  next  time.  No  problem  logging  on.to  Twitter.  Let  Twitter  run  the  census  #census2016  #censusfail  Dumbest  IT  Country  Bumpkins  Dopes  #census2016  #CensusFail  https://t.co/m4S2Q5wHhY  @hamishblake  Not  sure  if  the  #rugby7s  live  feed  or  the  #census2016  would  have  more  traffic  in  Aus...  Just  wondering  will  #census2016  show  Australia  has  a  shortage  or  elite  athletes  living  in  the  country?  #censusfail  #censusfailed  #census2016  #probablywonttryagain  https://t.co/pSp8WFCzts  "Due  to  high  demand,  there  are  technical  issues  with  #census2016.  In  the  meantime,  here's  a  pretty  cat."  @720perth  https://t.co/GPGnL3nqId  Maybe  the  REAL  test  of  the  #census2016  is  to  find  how  long  we  all  will  keep  clicking  refresh  on  a  dud  site,  and  the  winner  gets  an  iPod?  @TurnbullMalcolm  We  can't  get  on  #census2016  website  Is  it  too  late  to  ask  for  paper  copy  or  was  this  fundraising  @LiberalAus  style  #auspol

  @narendramodi  ji  samvidan  ki  maa  bhain  ek  mat  kijiye...  #DemocracyVSModi  https://t.co/okMfDDE6mE  Delhiites  will  reject  Narendra  Modi  for  his  revenge  politics  against  People  of  Delhi  #DemocracyVSModi  https://t.co/XGHpfrDZRV  LG  can  do  whatever  he  wants!  AAP  will  continue  to  serve  the  public  fearlessly.  #DemocracyVSModi  https://t.co/B1XNgjuLQy  People  of  Delhi  will  reject  Narendra  Modi  for  his  revenge  politics  against  them.  #DemocracyVSModi  https://t.co/no0DuYHzWc  World  across  the  tide  has  turned  against  dictators.  LG  refuses  to  acknowledge  public  outrage  &  digs  his  own  grave.  #DemocracyVSModi  Can  there  be  any  peace  at  all  with  LG's  megalomania  sweeping  unchecked  over  Delhi  eroding  democracy?  #DemocracyVSModi  Fear  is  not  tool  of  capable  but  cowardly,  power  obsessed  outcasts.  LG  must  accept  learn  to  let  go.  #DemocracyVSModi  In  LG  vs  AAP,  Delhi  suffers  most.  Regardless,  He  continues  his  obstruct  &  usurp  policy  with  no  end  in  sight.  #DemocracyVSModi  इस  देश  में  सविधान  नही  बल्कि  LG  साहब  के  रूल  चलेंगे  !  #DemocracyVSModi
